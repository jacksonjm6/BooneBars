# BooneBars

This map showcases the walking route of three different bars in Boone. The route is the ideal footpath, starting on west King Street at the Veterans Memorial monument near the Appalachian Theatre. From there we walk down Depot Street, hitting River Street, leading to River Street Ale House. From there, we go down River Street, strolling down App State's campus, crossing the street and hitting Lil'y Snack Bar. We then walk up Blowing Rock Road briefly before crossing the street and walking across the East side of ASU's campus, going past the student union, briefly on Howard Street and back onto King Street for Boone Saloon. 

This optimized route is for myself or another individual starting and finishing on King Street. 

Although this map is very fun, this map lacks many features and only highlights the specific starting point (Veterans Memorial), ending point (Boone Saloon) and 2 middle points (River Street Ale House and Lily's Snack Bar).
